Weather Dashboard

The weather dashboard uses the Open Weather Map API to gather weather information by location.

After the user inputs a city name, the city name and current date are displayed. Additionally, the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index will displayed for the city that was searched.

Using a seperate API data collection from Open Weather allows the user access to the 5 day forecast for the city that was searched. The forecast dates, temperature, and humidity are displayed to the user in addition to the current weather.

The deployed application can be found at (https://tldav.github.io/hw6-js-weather/)
